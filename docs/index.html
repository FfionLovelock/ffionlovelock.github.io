              <p>Richard III (Richard the third) could well qualify as one of the most treacherous of Shakespearean characters. This Shakespeare play is an evil depiction of the scheming villainous crimes of Richard III the Duke of Gloucester and brother of King Edward IV. Richard’s heinous act of taking over the throne is marked by several murders of his own family including Edward the Prince of Wales. After marrying the Prince’s widow Queen Anne, his plotting succeeds in him becoming King.</p>
              <p>Richards’s victory is short-lived after his tyrannical succession is ended in defeat by Henry the Earl of Richmond who succeeds Richard as King Henry the VII.</p>
